cities = { santa_cruz: 'chill', new_york: 'intense' }
cities.each { |x, y| p "#{ x } is #{ y }" }

# Question4
# Only for practice:
# See difference between the following lines of code

box = { height: 10.5 }
puts box.fetch(:size)
# It gives error as size key is not present in box hash
# we have to change code as,
pus box.fetch(:height)
# Output is 10.5

puts box[:size]
# It gives error as size key is not present in box hash
# we have to change code as,
puts box[:height]
# Output is 10.5
